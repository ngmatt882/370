# 370 Project 1

This project was created to develop a basic understanding of how machine code works.

Project 1A translates a program written in assembly into machine code. Project 1B simulates how the program would work, given the machine code file.

1B also includes a suboptimal multiplication program, mult.as, written in assembly.
